# Neighbourhood Map Project

## Intention
* I created this app with the intention of showing off all of the awesomeness that Brighton has to offer.
* I wanted it to be a portfolio piece I could be proud of.
* I felt it needed to be an image led site to help the user to engage with the vibe that Brighton has to offer.
* The aim was to integrate these intentions into an app which also fulfilled the project brief

## Running the App
* The app is fully responsive and should run on any OS.
* It has been fully tested in Google Chrome only.
* There are no particular dependencies that a user would have to install.
* To see the google maps error handling, popups must not be blocked by your browser


## How to run this application

1. Install npm's simple http server if this is not already installed globally.
2. Run **http-server -p 8080** from inside the projects root directory.
3. Load your localhost address including port into the browser: **http://127.0.0.1:8080**
4. The application will run the jasmine tests on load and print the results at the bottom of the web page.


## Concerns
* I have slight concerns about performance with the site being so image heavy, The reason I chose to do it this way rather than hotlinking was becuase the site is so image driven I needed 100% reassurance that the images would be available. The reason I didn't go for a flickr api was becuase my image requirements were so specific I figured this was the easiest way to work it.

## Final thoughts
* I am pleased with the product I have created.
* I am partiularly pleased with the originality of the project and I feel it does my home town justice.
* I have learnt **a lot** by creating this project, and I feel it has stretched my programming skills significantly. I am also a lot more confident in taking a javascript based project from start to finish now which I am very pleased with.
* I've enjoyed working with a framework and definitely intend to look further into other available javascript frameworks for future project work.
* I hope I have managed to fulfil all of the project criteria, albeit in a rather unconventional manor!
