		"infoContent": "<p>Brighton has a diverse, quirky and charming range of landmarks both historic and modern. The elaborate Brighton Pavilion, Indian style on the outside, Chinese style on the inside, sets the scene for the ecclectic mishmash of the city that has grown up around it. One of its crowning moments for me was the Dr Blighty light show in Brighton festival 2016 where the whole building was lit up in a spectacular fashion using a stunning colour palette as diverse as Brighton itself. You can see a picture of one of the light formations when you click on the landmark marker.</p><p>On our vibrant city coast line there are a number of diverse landmarks: the two distinctive and quirky piers stretching out into the English Channel, the historic and recently beautifully refurbished bandstand, and the brand new shiny, but locally controversial i360 tower - the tallest structure in Sussex and in the Guinness book of world records as being the world most slender tower.</p><p>The Brighton wheel, the charming tourist attraction east of the pier was sadly dismantled on the opening of the i360, compounding the controversy surrounding Brightons newest landmark. I have included the Brighton wheel in this section on landmarks because frankly, we miss it a little bit!</p>",

	"infoContent": "<h4>The People</h4><p>Brighton - the gay capital of England - is brimming with eccentric characters. Anything goes here in Brighton and Hove and even the most extreme of fashion statements are accepted as the norm. Brightonians are unconventional as standard. We are the only  constituency in the UK to vote in political leadership by the Green Party. There is in fact a local movement to become an independent state - The People's Republic Of Brighton And Hove! In the current political climate, one could argue that it’s an ideal that doesn't seem quite so absurd! And we have even adopted our own unconventional local spirit - Tuaca - a smooth sweet shot served best cold.</p><h4>The Events</h4><p>Brighton has an impressive Calender of annual events. The whole month of May Brighton is wrapped up in a party atmosphere as the city celebrates the Brighton festival and Brighton fringe both running concurrently for the 4 week period. With street theatre, spectacular costumes, free performances, music, art installations, pop up bars and venues, it's every locals favourite time of year! Other organised events that Brighton boasts include the annual Pride celebration, one of the biggest in Europe, the Kemptown Carnival, Paddle Round the Pier, The Great Escape, October's Comedy Festival, Wildlife Festival, Funk the Format, Shakedown / Boundary Festival, Together the People, the Brighton Zombie Walk, the Naked Bike Ride - we have an occasion for whatever your preference!</p><h4>The Vibe</h4><p>Even when there's not an organised event on, the sheer volume of visitors in the summer months, the density of pubs and clubs of every description, and the best summer hang out spots all equal one thing: Brighton vibes - as standard! If the sun has been shining, or the moon is full, or the day has a y in it, there will be crazy's to be found and fun to be had.</p>",
